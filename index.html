            <h3>SHARO</h3>
            <p>
              SHARO is a robot dog I built with a partner. I was mainly
              responsible for the software of the robot, which was built from
              scratch. I came up with a novel way to define the motion of its
              limbs with BÃ©zier curves.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also integrated computer vision models for facial detection and
              emotion classification, which made it particularly engaging for
              kids at various events.
            </p>
            <p>
              To fit all the code on a Raspberry Pi 4, I optimized the code with
              multiprocessing and moved the inverse kinematics calculations to
              Rust.

            <h3>PCHELICHKA</h3>
            <p>
              PCHELICHKA is an autonomoous drone-bee, again built with a
              partner. He provided the hardware while I came up with an
              innovative end effector and designed and tuned the control
              strategy. The drone uses only its camera for navigation and
              stabilization, and the motors are controlled with a cascading PID
              controller from position to velocity to acceleration to pitch,
              roll, and yaw rate commands, which are then sent to the drone
              through the FPV radio.
              <b>The drone is entirely autonomous form lift-off to landing.</b>

            <h3>FIRST Robotics Competition</h3>
            <p>
              I am a co-founder and the current captain of the only Bulgarian
              FRC team <b>ACS Phoenix #9089</b> We have been participating in
              the competition since the 2023 season.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2024, I took over as captain and we became 25/51, compared to
              48/49 in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the 2025 season, I have grown the team to over 30 people, and
              we are currently well into the build season.

            <h3>Paintball</h3>
            <p>
              I was contacted by a local chain of paintball arenas to create a
              device for a king-of-the-hill style game. I designed and
              fabricated a total of 5 "checkpoints".
            </p>
            <p>
              An esp32 is the "brain" of each checkpoint and controls 2
              high-power LEDs through Darilngton transistors. A UPS battery
              powers the entire system, and the esp32 through a step-down
              converter. The checkpoints are wirelessly set up before play and
              measure the duration that each team controls the checkpoint,
              producing a winner at the end.

            <h3>Space Challenges</h3>
            <p>
              I attended a 5-week-long summer bootcamp where along with a
              rigorous academic program, consisting of daily lectures and weekly
              survival quizzes, we were separated into teams with the task of
              building ground stations to communicate with a real satellite.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was the team captain and mainly focused on the electroncis and
              software. Along with control of the station, I also built a
              satellite tracker with Rust that automatically started the station
              when a satellite pass is occuring. In the end, we were awarded for
              best project documentation and I was among the few to successfully
              graduate the bootcamp.

            <p>
              LocusLibri is a social media for bookworms. It lets users keep a
              reading list of books they enjoy and matches users based on their
              reading preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
              I made the entire web platform myself, back-end to front-end and
              marketing materials.

            <p>
              I built the app entirely by myself with React, MongoDB, and

            <p>
              I was a part of a 3-person team that participated in the NSS Space
              Settlement Contest. We produced a 50-page proposal for a space
              station as a future human habitat, complete with engineering
              design, governance strucutre, and economical analysis. I
              personally came up with the governance hierarchy and some critical
              systems like logistics.
